# Express.js Crash Course
## Basic Setup
This is a basic Express.js project, creating a basic API from a JSON file, and performing CRUD requests in memory.

These requests test both using a backend api and sending the response to the browser as JSON, and a server-side rendered application using Handlebars for basic rendering of our API.

This is based off of Brad Traversy's Express.js crash course, and a sequel to his Node.js crash course.
